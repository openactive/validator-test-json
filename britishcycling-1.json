        "description": "Come and join our friendly Saturday morning Women's Club Rides!We are a friendly group of women who are keen to invite more women to come along and join our great club \"The Port Sunlight Wheelers\". We are delighted with the addition of Women Only rides to our club and the increase in female riders it is bringing. You do not initially have to be a club member to join us...come along for a few rides to see if you like it first! Our rides offer a fun and supportive way for women who want to ride at club level without the anxieties and pressures that sometimes women can feel at the thought of riding with a male dominated club ride. You can choose to stay with the Women's Rides, or use it as a stepping stone to the traditional Sunday Club Rides or indeed dip in and out of both, it's a good alternative if you can't make a Sunday. The wider club offers lots of opportunities and a wealth of knowledge for those who wish to try out time-trial or cyclo-cross, as well as the annual club cycling weekend away, trips abroad or social events and of course access to our lovely club kit! There are also events for children of members (The Women's rides are for adult women over 16 years old).The Women's Club Rides will take you into rolling Cheshire or the Welsh hills and are around 40-50 miles long at about 14-15mph average speed, depending on terrain and conditions. Whilst you would be expected to be of a certain capability we will not leave anyone behind and always wait on hills. Also we do not usually have a cafe stop so make sure you bring enough fluids and fuel to sustain you. The map shown is typical example of one of our rides.We meet fortnightly at Eureka Cycle Café (The Mills) at about 9am for a cuppa and a chat before leaving at 9.30am. Please park (free) in the Tudor Rose car park on the other side of the crossroads. If you don't want a cuppa first just meet outside the cafe at 9.30am.My contact details are below...let me know you are coming so I can look out for you ;)Alternatively we are currently running slightly shorter, easier paced fortnightly rides \"Sunlight Women's Easy Rider!\" from Nets Cafe, Burton (on alternate fortnight to the club ride) also on this web site. These are for women who are already riding regularly but wish to gain experience of group riding including speed and endurance. They aim to join the regular Women's Club Run by late spring 2018. The \"easy rider\" will then become a Women's Club Ride as above hopefully with enough women to run weekly. There is no expectation that you should join the club until you are riding on the longer Women's Club Ride.**INFORMATION** For all rides please make sure you fit the minimum fitness requirements and are riding a road bike (drop handlebars) with clipped in pedals. Please see FAQ on Sunlight Women's Rides Group for appropriate equipment, clothing, nutrition etc.We look forward to welcoming you!Best Wishes Nicky Please note none of our rides are suitable for novice/occasional/leisure riders, hybrid bikes or for flat pedals. Riders could instead look at Breeze rides on this website or Wirral Belles (google) .If you need more info or to check if our rides are for you then please send me a message:on this website send me a buddy request and I will message youfacebook @sunlightwomenscyclingemail velospeed123@gmail.com",

You can choose to stay with the Women's Rides, or use it as a stepping stone to the traditional Sunday Club Rides or indeed dip in and out of both, it's a good alternative if you can't make a Sunday. The wider club offers lots of opportunities and a wealth of knowledge for those who wish to try out time-trial or cyclo-cross, as well as the annual club cycling weekend away, trips abroad or social events and of course access to our lovely club kit! There are also events for children of members (The Women's rides are for adult women over 16 years old).<br /><br />The Women's Club Rides will take you into rolling Cheshire or the Welsh hills and are around 40-50 miles long at about 14-15mph average speed, depending on terrain and conditions. Whilst you would be expected to be of a certain capability we will not leave anyone behind and always wait on hills. Also we do not usually have a cafe stop so make sure you bring enough fluids and fuel to sustain you. The map shown is typical example of one of our rides.<br />We meet fortnightly at Eureka Cycle Café (The Mills) at about 9am for a cuppa and a chat before leaving at 9.30am. Please park (free) in the Tudor Rose car park on the other side of the crossroads. If you don't want a cuppa first just meet outside the cafe at 9.30am.<br />My contact details are below...let me know you are coming so I can look out for you ;)<br /><br />Alternatively we are currently running slightly shorter, easier paced fortnightly rides \"Sunlight Women's Easy Rider!\" from Nets Cafe, Burton (on alternate fortnight to the club ride) also on this web site. These are for women who are already riding regularly but wish to gain experience of group riding including speed and endurance. They aim to join the regular Women's Club Run by late spring 2018. The \"easy rider\" will then become a Women's Club Ride as above hopefully with enough women to run weekly. There is no expectation that you should join the club until you are riding on the longer Women's Club Ride.<br /><br />**INFORMATION** For all rides please make sure you fit the minimum fitness requirements and are riding a road bike (drop handlebars) with clipped in pedals.

There are also events for children of members (The Women's rides/Club rides however are for adults over 16 years old).\r\nWe have two Sunlight Women's Club Rides both running fortnightly on opposite weeks:\r\n1/ \"Women's club ride\" Our faster paced, often hillier ride will take you into rolling Cheshire or the Welsh hills and is around 40-50 miles long at about 14-15mph average speed, depending on terrain and conditions. Whilst you would be expected to be of a a good level of cycling fitness and capable of keeping up with the pace we aim not to leave anyone behind and always regroup at the top of hills.(Sometimes riders come with a backup plan to turn off early if they are unsure if they can complete the full ride at the required pace). We ask that new riders to the group first do a 'steady ride' as below.\r\n2/ \"Women's steady club ride\" Our popular, slightly shorter, steadier paced ride has developed from women who where keen to gain experience of group riding and increase their distance, speed and endurance. It is about 40 miles in length at 13-14 mph average speed and will take you into the flatter parts of Cheshire and the Welsh border.\r\nFor both rides we do not usually have a cafe stop so make sure you bring enough fluids and fuel to sustain you!\r\nWe look forward to welcoming you!\r\nBest Wishes Nicky \r\n**INFORMATION** For all rides please make sure you fit the minimum fitness requirements and are riding a road bike (drop handlebars) with clipped in pedals. Please see FAQ below.\r\nPlease note none of our rides are suitable for novice/occasional/leisure riders, hybrid bikes or for flat pedals. Riders could instead look at Breeze rides on this website or Wirral Belles (google) .\r\nDates for all rides can be found at https://www.letsride.co.uk/groups/s...  \r\n \r\nIf you need more info or to check if our rides are for you then please send me a message:\r\nfacebook @sunlightwomenscycling\r\nemail velospeed123@gmail.com\r\nOr look at our club website The Port Sunlight Wheelers  http://portsunlightwheelers.co.uk/\r\n\r\nFAQ                        \r\nHow fit do I need to be? \r\nLonger Women's Club Ride: New riders should be confident that they can ride 40 miles at 14-15mph average speed. Nobody is usually left behind and we always wait on hills (although obviously a certain level of fitness is expected). All riders should come on our steady ride first!\r\nShort ride: New riders should be reasonably confident they can ride 30 miles at 13-14mph average speed and should have a desire to continue build their fitness through regular riding. Please message me if you are unsure.       \r\nNB Although these rides are easier paced than our longer ride they are not suitable for novice riders who should instead look at Breeze rides.                  \r\n\r\nWhat equipment do I need?\r\nA roadworthy road bike (with narrow tyres, drop handlebars and clip in pedals)\r\nA pump, spare innertube and tyre levers and be able to use them! There are some great Utube videos to help if you need a practice.\r\nA multi tool is useful too.\r\nWhat about appropriate clothing/bags?: Riders can carry a saddle bag with tools etc and use a jersey with back pockets to carry food, raincoat etc. Bags, backpacks or panniers are not required. Clothing should be close fitting Lycra. The aim is to be as light and aerodynamic as possible. Loose clothes and extra bags will hinder your progress and can be dangerous while riding in a group!\r\nChange for cafe (or taxi/train home in case of total bike breakdown - hopefully never needed!)\r\nMobile phone. \r\nMost riders want to use some sort of cycle computer or smart-phone app to log their rides with speed, average speed, distance etc. They also provide a useful means to measure your improvements.\r\nEnough fluids/energy drink/gels/food etc as required to sustain you through the ride. \r\nHelmets are not compulsory but advised. Lycra however is!                                  \r\n\r\nDo I have to be a member of Port Sunlight Wheelers?\r\nRiders do not have to be a member to come along and ride with us to start, however if you ride regularly with us then membership would be an expectation. There is a once yearly fee of currently £20 that enables you access all the activities and experience the club has to offer, not to mention our lovely kit!\r\n\r\nLiability and Insurance: \r\nWhile the organisers of the ride will do all in their reasonable control to make the ride as safe as possible, all riders take part at their own risk. It is highly recommended that all riders have some form of insurance (at least 3rd party liability) Please see terms and conditions at the foot of the page.\r\n\r\n",

There are some great Utube videos to help if you need a practice.\r\nA multi tool is useful too.\r\nWhat about appropriate clothing/bags?: Riders can carry a saddle bag with tools etc and use a jersey with back pockets to carry food, raincoat etc. Bags, backpacks or panniers are not required. Clothing should be close fitting Lycra. The aim is to be as light and aerodynamic as possible. Loose clothes and extra bags will hinder your progress and can be dangerous while riding in a group!\r\nChange for cafe (or taxi/train home in case of total bike breakdown - hopefully never needed!)\r\nMobile phone. \r\nMost riders want to use some sort of cycle computer or smart-phone app to log their rides with speed, average speed, distance etc. They also provide a useful means to measure your improvements.\r\nEnough fluids/energy drink/gels/food etc as required to sustain you through the ride. \r\nHelmets are not compulsory but advised. Lycra however is!                                  \r\n\r\nDo I have to be a member of Port Sunlight Wheelers?\r\nRiders do not have to be a member to come along and ride with us to start, however if you ride regularly with us then membership would be an expectation. There is a once yearly fee of currently £20 that enables you access all the activities and experience the club has to offer, not to mention our lovely kit!\r\n\r\nLiability and Insurance: \r\nWhile the organisers of the ride will do all in their reasonable control to make the ride as safe as possible, all riders take part at their own risk. It is highly recommended that all riders have some form of insurance (at least 3rd party liability) Please see terms and conditions at the foot of the page.\r\n\r\n",

        "meetingPoint": "Come and join our friendly Saturday morning Women's Club Rides!<br />We are a friendly group of women who are keen to invite more women to come along and join our great club \"The Port Sunlight Wheelers\". We are delighted with the addition of Women Only rides to our club and the increase in female riders it is bringing. <br /><br />To support more women we are currently running an easier paced fortnightly ride \"Sunlight Women's Easy Rider!\" from Nets Cafe, Burton (on each alternate fortnight to our regular Sunlight Women's Club Ride - also on this web site). This ride is for women who are already riding regularly but wish to gain experience of group riding, including speed and endurance. They aim to join the regular Women's Club Run by late spring 2018. The \"easy rider\" will then cease and  become a Women's Club Ride as below hopefully with enough women to run weekly. <br />There is no expectation that you should join the club until you are riding on the longer Women's Club Ride. <br /><br />The Easy Rider rides will gradually increase between 25-40miles with the aim of riding similar routes on the map shown at about 14-15mph average speed by the Summer. We do not usually have a cafe stop so make sure you bring enough fluids & fuel to sustain you.<br />We meet fortnightly at Nets Café, Burton Marsh at about 9am for a cuppa and a chat before leaving at 9.30am. Free parking available alongside the marsh on the road at the bottom of Denhall lane (or if full in the cafe). If you don't want a cuppa first just meet outside the cafe at 9.30am.<br />My contact details are below...let me know you are coming so I can look out for you ;)<br /><br />Our Women's Club Rides offer a fun and supportive way for women who want to ride at club level without the anxieties and pressures that sometimes women can feel at the thought of riding with a male dominated club ride. You can choose to stay with the Women's Rides, or use it as a stepping stone to the traditional Sunday Club Rides or indeed dip in and out of both, it's a good alternative if you can't make a Sunday. The wider club offers lots of opportunities and a wealth of knowledge for those who wish to try out time-trial or cyclo-cross, as well as the annual club cycling weekend away, trips abroad or social events and of course access to our lovely club kit! There are also events for children of members (The Women's rides are for adult women over 16 years old).<br /><br />The longer Women's Club Rides will take you into rolling Cheshire or the Welsh hills and are around 40-50 miles long at about 14-15mph average speed, depending on terrain and conditions. Whilst you would be expected to be of a certain capability we will not leave anyone behind and always wait on hills. Also we do not usually have a cafe stop so make sure you bring enough fluids and fuel to sustain you. <br /><br />**INFORMATION** For all rides please make sure you fit the minimum fitness requirements and are riding a road bike (drop handlebars) with clipped in pedals. Please see FAQ on Sunlight Women's Rides Group for appropriate equipment, clothing, nutrition etc.<br /><br />We look forward to welcoming you!<br />Best Wishes Nicky <br /><br />Please note none of our rides are suitable for novice/occasional/leisure riders, hybrid bikes or for flat pedals. Riders could instead look at Breeze rides on this website or Wirral Belles (google) .<br />If you need more info or to check if our rides are for you then please send me a message:<br />on this website send me a buddy request and I will message you<br />facebook @sunlightwomenscycling<br />email velospeed123@gmail.com<br />",

There are also events for children of members (The Women's rides/Club rides however are for adults over 16 years old).\r\nWe have two Sunlight Women's Club Rides both running fortnightly on opposite weeks:\r\n1/ \"Women's club ride\" Our faster paced, often hillier ride will take you into rolling Cheshire or the Welsh hills and is around 40-50 miles long at about 14-15mph average speed, depending on terrain and conditions. Whilst you would be expected to be of a a good level of cycling fitness and capable of keeping up with the pace we aim not to leave anyone behind and always regroup at the top of hills.(Sometimes riders come with a backup plan to turn off early if they are unsure if they can complete the full ride at the required pace). We ask that new riders to the group first do a 'steady ride' as below.\r\n2/ \"Women's steady club ride\" Our popular, slightly shorter, steadier paced ride has developed from women who where keen to gain experience of group riding and increase their distance, speed and endurance. It is about 40 miles in length at 13-14 mph average speed and will take you into the flatter parts of Cheshire and the Welsh border.\r\nFor both rides we do not usually have a cafe stop so make sure you bring enough fluids and fuel to sustain you!\r\nWe look forward to welcoming you!\r\nBest Wishes Nicky \r\n**INFORMATION** For all rides please make sure you fit the minimum fitness requirements and are riding a road bike (drop handlebars) with clipped in pedals.

Nobody is usually left behind and we always wait on hills (although obviously a certain level of fitness is expected). All riders should come on our steady ride first!\r\nShort ride: New riders should be reasonably confident they can ride 30 miles at 13-14mph average speed and should have a desire to continue build their fitness through regular riding.

This is the first of four rides that HSBC UK Breeze Dunstable is organizing.We will meet at Creasey Park, Dunstable, and ride from here out on the lanes to Edlesborough, stop planned for coffee & cake break at the Heirloom café (http://www.heirloom.cafe/) and then a loop back to Dunstable, planned total time 2.5 hours. This is a short 9 mile ride, but should be nice to get on bikes locally again :-) It is recommended when riding in winter to dress in layers, with special attention to feet and hands.  Do bring a spare inner tube with you, even if you are not confident to do on your own there are plenty of people who can help.  ",

        "description": "This ride starts with a steady climb up Loxley Road before passing the Nag's Head and to the right of Damflask Reservoir, up the hill and through High Bradfield. Here we’re rewarded with fine views across Loxley Valley before passing through the village and up another shorter but slightly steeper hill that takes us to a right and a further steady climb up Bolsterstone Road. After a lovely swooping downhill section and a few modest ups and downs we reach Wigtwizzle where another climb takes us to a left turn on to Mortimer Road. There is then a bit of steady climbing and a longish descent before the first of two short, steep climbs that take past the Strines Inn. After a couple of miles of flat or slightly uphill road across the moor we turn left and it is then mostly downhill to Low Bradfield where we will have a coffee stop at the Flask End cafe before an easy few miles back to the start. Although there are some longish climbs in this ride and a few challenging hills, we’ll take it steady and stop for breathers whenever we need to. If you need to walk up any of the steeper bits, that is fine – we won’t leave anyone behind.IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTSWe recommend that all participants wear a helmet. Please make sure you wear appropriate clothing for the weather. As usual we do expect you to have ensured your bike is roadworthy and that you have carried out basic pre-ride checks; we recommend that you also carry at least one spare inner tube, a pump (CO2 inflators are also highly recommended). It is also a good idea to carry a spare chain link that matches your bike’s chain (e.g. 9, 10 or 11 speed). If you have a mechanical problem we will do our best to assist you and/or lend you an inner tube or repair kit if we can, but it is always best to be self-reliant. Don’t forget to bring money for refreshments and a mobile phone.DISCLAIMER\tThis is a purely social group of like-minded people sharing a love of cycling, it is not a formal organisation nor does it have any form of legal structure. We do not profess to be trained ride leaders but do have experience of doing so. You are free to choose to ride with us but in doing so please note that you do so in acceptance that this is entirely at your own risk. We cannot accept responsibility for any loss or injury suffered as a result of your participation. Please also read the terms and conditions on the website.",

There is parking and it's 1.40 for two hoursWe will head out through town via Berhmapsted road towards Cholesbury and Hawridge. This is a flat, quieter country road and good place to get your confidence.

In the village we ride past gorgeous houses and pubs to the Country Park, where we pause for refreshments in the café. Our return takes us up a hill near a golf club after which we are rewarded with some lovely countryside views. Heading past Denham airfield we then have a gentle ride back to Watford Cycle Hub, where you can have another cuppa or chat to the team before heading home.NB: This route is best suited to hybrids. Road bikers: this route is do-able on a road bike provided you don't mind a bit of mud and cycling on a few rougher sections on the Grand Union Canal towpath. Mtbs will be fine; you're just getting more of a work out on the couple of climbs (139 metres in total for this route, which is mainly flat).Your Ride Leaders for this group looking to average between 8-10 mph over the route are: Yves Remedios & Tom Barber.There are two pace categories for this ride: the other group is a 10-11 mph group and the link to that version of the ride is here, should that pace category better suit you:https://www.letsride.co.uk/rides/watford-cycle-hub-denham-delights-pace-average-10-11-mphPlease bring money for the cafe if you want to buy refreshments at this week's coffee stop. :)Please also bring two spare inner tubes in case of puncture - as changing an inner tube is faster than getting out the rubber glue. The Ride Leader will happily help if anyone in the group has a puncture on the day. Watford Cycle Hub sell inner tubes from £4 new, or recycled ones for 50p patched, £1 with no patches, should you need to purchase one. Please check your bike is in good working order before the ride - especially that your brakes are working & your tyres are pumped.If your bike might need a little more TLC or hasn't been ridden for a while, you can always bring it in for a free assessment; we're Not-For-Profit, do free bike assessments and promise to give you an honest price if your bike needs fixing, fine tuning or a full service. :)If you're running late on the day, please call Watford Cycle Hub on: 01923 223994. We may be able to wait for you - if we know you are on your way! :)",

This makes the rides more enjoyable and more sociable. \r\n\r\nWhere does this group cycle and distances?\r\n\r\nAll rides start from West Drayton Train Station (WDS) near the bike racks, the terrains usually involve bridleways/cycle lanes/canal tow paths.  Here are some examples\r\n\r\n3 Parks – Langley, Black & Denham Parks approximately 20-30 Miles\r\n\r\nPub 2 Pub – Malt Shovel to the sister pub Coy Carp – 10 – 15 Miles\r\n\r\nPark 2 Park – Minet and Cranford Parks 15 – 20 Miles\r\n\r\nBig Park Route – Osterley and Richmond – 30+ Miles\r\n\r\nCycle London – Cycling into London for the prudential Freecycle Ride – 60 Miles\r\n\r\nA to B – Ashford Staines to Brighton – 60+ Miles\r\n\r\nInterested In Joining\r\n\r\nWe have a facebook group - TFCC Facebook Group  just join the group.\r\n\r\nWe advertise on the Hillingdon Council Events - Hillingdon Events\r\n\r\nContact ME – Hannah Dunn on 07867824809\r\n",

However, it is also an introduction to group cycling in the darkPlease make sure you have a road worthy bike, suitable clothing and a helmet. Lights will need be fitted to the front and rear of your bike.  It is also advisable to bring a spare inner tube and a pump. You may also wish to bring water to keep hydrated and a snack for sustenancePlease note:  The Vale of Belvoir Cycling Club also meet on Bingham Market Place, so please do not be alarmed if you see a bunch of cyclists in full on Lycra and on road bikes that don't look like they belong on a BREEZE ride..   They meet on the corner of the market place.  ",

Leaving the park by the gate on Russell Road, the route travels up past Kings Heath park and then through Walkers Heath to Primrose Hill where we enter the country lanes towards Forhill. The roads sweep along finally reaching Branson's Cross roundabout before heading through Tanworth with the ‘climb’ of Tom Hill – momentum should help you over but the effort should help you build up recovery strengths.

Approx 4.5 miles.Mountain biking is great fun and a good way to get fit so come along and give it a go.If you have any questions about this ride then you can e-mail us at breezenetworkeden@gmail.comor see our Facebook page for more information; Breeze Network Eden.
