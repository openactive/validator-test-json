#### Example for Rule 11

Not like this:

```javascript
  "numOfDays": null,
  "dayDuration": null,
```

Like this:

```javascript
  "subEvent": { /* Include this for NYC only, to enumerate the the schedule of individual sessions within the camp */
    "type": "Event",
    "name": "Netball Youth Camp",
    "duration": "PT5H", /* for NYC, day_duration as number of hours each day (e.g. "10am - 3pm" = "PT5H") */
    "eventSchedule": {
      "type": "Schedule",
      "startDate": "2014-09-01", /* for NYC this is the start date of the camp */
      "repeatCount": 3, /* for NYC num_of_days */
      "frequency": "P1D", /* assume all NYC camps are contiguous */
      "startTime": "10:00", /* for NYC, based on day_duration start time */
      "endTime": "15:00", /* for NYC based on day_duration end time */
    }
  }
```
