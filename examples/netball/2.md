#### Example of Rule 4

For the case where there is no location, no address, or no geo, the null properties should not be included, and objects that contain only nulls should also not be included.

So the below "location" property should not be included at all, as all objects within are null.

```javascript
"location": {
  "type": "Location",
  "name": null,
  "address": {
    "type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": null,
    "addressLocality": null,
    "addressRegion": null,
    "postalCode": null
  },
  "geo": {
    "type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": null,
    "longitude": null
  }
}
```
