#### Example Rule 5, 9 and 13

Not like this:

```javascript
"offer": [
  {
    "type": "Offer",
    "name": "Full price cost",
    "price": 45,
    "priceCurrency": "GBP",
    "url": "" /* Empty strings should be treated as null properties and not included */
  }
]
```

Like this:

```javascript
"offers": [ /* "offer" property should be named "offers" */
  {
    "type": "Offer",
    "name": "Full price cost",
    "price": "45.00", /* Price should always be a string with 2 decimal places */
    "priceCurrency": "GBP"
  }
]
```
