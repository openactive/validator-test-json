#### Example or Rule 7, Rule 8 and Rule 10

##### For Walking Netball

Not like this:

```javascript
"superEvent": {
  "identifier": "WN004801",
  "type": "Walking Netball",
  "lastSessionDate": "2018-07-30",
  "overview": "Walking Netball has evolved from a growing demand for walking sports. Often, one of netball’s strengths is that people never forget playing the sport and the memories as well as the love for the game never leave.\r\n\r\nWalking Netball is a slower version of the game; it is netball, but at a walking pace. The game has been designed so that anyone can play it regardless of age or fitness level.\r\n\r\nFrom those who have dropped out of the sport they love due to serious injury, to those who believed they had hung up their netball trainers many years ago, it really is for everyone.\r\n\r\nWomen the length of the country have begun playing the game of Walking Netball for the fun, laughter and camaraderie the social session brings, as much as the health benefits on offer. It can give those who feel isolated an outlet, provide an activity for those who don’t deem themselves fit enough to run anymore and offer a stepping stone for those looking for a pathway back into netball."

##### For Back to Netball

Not like this:

```javascript
"superEvent": {
  "identifier": "B2N005364",
  "type": "Back to Netball",
  "lastSessionDate": "2018-06-12",
  "overview": "Running across England since 2010, over 60,000 women have taken part in Back to Netball and realised the benefits of getting involved.  From losing weight, developing the body’s cardiovascular system and improving muscle tone, taking part in Back to Netball is great for you in so many ways.\r\n\r\nBack to Netball sessions are running across England and provide women of all ages with a gentle re-introduction to the sport.  Run by passionate and enthusiastic coaches, sessions cover the basics of the game including passing, footwork and shooting.  Sessions finish with a friendly game to put the skills you have learnt into practice.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need any special kit, just clothes that you feel comfortable exercising in and trainers ideally that lace up. Make sure you bring some water and that you’ve had a snack a couple of hours before hand, something like our lovely sponsors Mrs Crimbles flapjacks or a banana so you’ve got plenty of energy."
